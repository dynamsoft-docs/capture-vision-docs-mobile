# How to Prevent Project Build Failure after Shrinking Code?

This page provides you a possible solution when your project build fails after implementing the code obfuscation.

Generally, you donâ€™t have to add any configurations when shrinking your code because proguard rule is already configured in the aar.

```bash
-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {    
    native <methods>; 
}
-keep class com.dynamsoft.dbr.** { *; }
-keep class com.dynamsoft.dce.** { *; }
```
