# Dynamsoft Capture Vision iOS Edition - Documentation

Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) is a comprehensive SDK that integrates various functional products. It encompasses image capture, content understanding, result parsing, and interactive workflow. Essentially, DCV processes images to extract specific information that is meaningful within a business context.

DCV is designed to enable developers to quickly create conceptual prototypes within hours. It also offers the flexibility to handle more complex customizations for demanding tasks.

### Read about CaptureVisionTemplate

Using DCV in JavaScript involves:

1. Creating a `CaptureVisionRouter` instance.
2. Defining and binding an image source and a result receiver to the instance.
3. Specifying a template which defines how to process images.

Apparently, the use of DCV varies with the choice of template. Dynamsoft provides popular preset templates and will add more over time. To understand, adjust, or define your own template, read about [`CaptureVisionTemplate`]({{ site.docHomePage }}parameters/file/){:target="_blank"}.
