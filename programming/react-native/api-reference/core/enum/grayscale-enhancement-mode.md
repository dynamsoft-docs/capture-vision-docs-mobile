# EnumGrayscaleEnhancementMode

`EnumGrayscaleEnhancementMode` is an enumeration that determines which grayscale enhancement modes the library will apply before the detection process to improve the read rate of the barcodes in a given image or frame.

## Definition

*Assembly:* dynamsoft-capture-vision-react-native

```js
enum EnumGrayscaleEnhancementMode {
  GEM_SKIP = 0x0,
  GEM_AUTO = 0x1,
  GEM_GENERAL = 0x2,
  GEM_GRAY_EQUALIZE = 0x4,
  GEM_GRAY_SMOOTH = 0x8,
  GEM_SHARPEN_SMOOTH = 0x10
}
```

## Members

| Member | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `GEM_SKIP` | Disables any grayscale image preprocessing. Selecting this mode skips the preprocessing step, passing the image through to subsequent operations without modification. |
| `GEM_AUTO` | Automatic selection of grayscale enhancement mode which is currently not supported. Future implementations may automatically choose the most suitable enhancement based on image analysis. |
| `GEM_GENERAL` | Uses the original, unprocessed image for subsequent operations. This mode is selected when no specific grayscale enhancement is required, maintaining the image in its natural state. |
| `GEM_GRAY_EQUALIZE` | Applies a grayscale equalization algorithm to the image, enhancing contrast and detail in gray level. Suitable for images with poor contrast. |
| `GEM_GRAY_SMOOTH` | Implements a grayscale smoothing algorithm to reduce noise and smooth the image. This can be beneficial for images with high levels of grain or noise. |
| `GEM_SHARPEN_SMOOTH` | Enhances the image by applying both sharpening and smoothing algorithms. This mode aims to increase clarity and detail while reducing noise, offering a balanced approach to image preprocessing. |
