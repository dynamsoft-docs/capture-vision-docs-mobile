# CaptureVisionRouter Class

The `CaptureVisionRouter` class defines how a user interacts with image-processing and semantic-processing Dynamsoft products in their applications.

A `CaptureVisionRouter` instance accepts and processes images from an image source and returns processing results which may contain final results or intermediate results. The instance can also process video frames coming from a camera or a different image source as well, therefore providing the ability to capture results via an interactive video scenario or from static images.

## Definition

*Assembly:* dynamsoft_capture_vision_flutter

```dart
class CaptureVisionRouter
```

Returns the singleton instance of `CaptureVisionRouter`.

```dart
static CaptureVisionRouter get instance;

### addResultFilter

Adds a result filter to process the captured results. This filter is of type [`MultiFrameResultCrossFilter`](../utility/multi-frame-cross-filter.md).

```dart
Future<void> addResultFilter(MultiFrameResultCrossFilter filter)
```

**Remarks**

Adding a result filter is not needed for the operation of the Capture Vision Router, but it can help improve the accuracy of the results by verifying them across multiple image frames.

### addResultReceiver

Adds a result receiver that listens for any captured results. This receiver is a callback function that is triggered once a captured result is produced - whether it is successful, cancelled, or failed.

```dart
Future<void> addResultReceiver(CapturedResultReceiver receiver)
```

**Remarks**

To learn about the different result receivers that you can add, please refer to [`CapturedResultReceiver`](captured-result-receiver.md). Please note that adding a result receiver is necessary to getting the results that are produced by the Capture Vision Router instance.

### capture

Processes an image using the specified template and processes it - outputting a [`CapturedResult`](captured-result.md) containing the result(s) if there was no exception or error thrown.

```dart
Future<CapturedResult> capture(ImageData imageData, String templateName) async
```

**Remarks**

The template that is used during processing can be a preset template (one of [`EnumPresetTemplate`](../enum/preset-template.md)) or a customized JSON template that you create or that is provided to you by the Dynamsoft team. This method is to be used specifically when working with *static images*.

### captureFile

Processes an image from a file (specified by a file path) using the specified template, returning the [`CapturedResult`](captured-result.md) once the process is done.

```dart
Future<CapturedResult> captureFile(String filePath, String templateName) async
```

**Remarks**

The template that is used during processing can be a preset template (one of [`EnumPresetTemplate`](../enum/preset-template.md)) or a customized JSON template that you create or that is provided to you by the Dynamsoft team. This method is to be used specifically when working with *static images*.

### captureFileBytes

Processes an image from a byte array using the specified template, returning the [`CapturedResult`](captured-result.md) once the process is done.

```dart
Future<CapturedResult> captureFileBytes(Uint8List bytes, String templateName) async
```

**Remarks**

The template that is used during processing can be a preset template (one of [`EnumPresetTemplate`](../enum/preset-template.md)) or a customized JSON template that you create or that is provided to you by the Dynamsoft team. This method is to be used specifically when working with *static images*.

### clearDLModelBuffers

Clears the buffer used by deep learning models to free up memory and resources used by the Capture Vision Router instance for its operation.

```dart
static Future<void> clearDLModelBuffers()
```

### getIntermediateResultManager

Retrieves the [`IntermediateResultManager`](../utility/intermediate-result-manager.md) instance which allows the user to snap the original image that contains the captured result.

```dart
IntermediateResultManager getIntermediateResultManager()
```

**Remarks**

In order to get the original image that the captured result was taken from (especially in an interactive video scenario where the input is a camera feed), you will need to use the [`getOriginalImage`](../utility/intermediate-result-manager.md#getoriginalimage) method of the `IntermediateResultManager` instance.

### getSimplifiedSettings

Returns a subset of the full applied settings as a [`SimplifiedCaptureVisionSettings`](simplified-capture-vision-settings.md) object. This object contains the simplified settings of the Capture Vision Router instance, which in turn contains the simplified settings of the functional product used.

```dart
Future<SimplifiedCaptureVisionSettings?> getSimplifiedSettings(String templateName) async
```

**Remarks**

The templateName parameter represents the Capture Vision template that has been applied, whether it is a [preset template](../enum/preset-template.md) or a custom template defined in a JSON template file or string. To learn how to use the `getSimplifiedSettings`, please refer to this [section of the Foundational User Guide]({{ site.dbr_flutter }}foundational-user-guide.md#using-simplifiedcapturevisionsettings).

### getTemplateNames

Returns a list of all available Capture Vision template names when a custom template is used via [`initSettings`](#initsettings).

```dart
Future<List<String>> getTemplateNames() async
```

**Remarks**

A single template file/string can contain multiple Capture Vision templates, so this method will list each of the template(s) contained within the single template file/string. Each template can then be used with any of the capture methods, but only one at a time.

### initSettings

Initializes the settings of the `CaptureVisionRouter` instance using a JSON template (as a JSON string). To learn how to use a customized JSON template, please refer to this [section of the Foundational User Guide]({{ site.dbr_flutter }}foundational-user-guide.md#using-a-json-template).

```dart
Future<void> initSettings(String content)
```

> *Exception* - "Failed to initialize settings"

### initSettingsFromFile

Initializes the settings of the `CaptureVisionRouter` instance using a JSON template (as a JSON file). To learn how to use a customized JSON template, please refer to this [section of the Foundational User Guide]({{ site.dbr_flutter }}foundational-user-guide.md#using-a-json-template).

```dart
Future<void> initSettingsFromFile(String filePath) async
```

> *Exception* - "Failed to initialize settings from file"

### outputSettings

Outputs the specified Capture Vision template's settings as a JSON string. If `includeDefaultValues` is set to true, the output will include the default settings values.

```dart
Future<String?> outputSettings(String templateName, bool includeDefaultValues) async
```

> *Exception* - "Failed to output settings"

### outputSettingsToFile

Outputs the specified Capture Vision template's settings to a JSON file. If `includeDefaultValues` is set to true, the output will include the default settings values.

```dart
Future<void> outputSettingsToFile(String templateName, String filePath, bool includeDefaultValues) async
```

> *Exception* - "Failed to output settings to file"

### removeAllResultFilters

Removes all the result filters from the Capture Vision Router instance.

```dart
Future<void> removeAllResultFilters()
```

### removeAllResultReceivers

Removes all result receivers from the Capture Vision Router instance.

```dart
Future<void> removeAllResultReceivers()
```

### removeResultFilter

Removes a previously added result filter.

```dart
Future<void> removeResultFilter(MultiFrameResultCrossFilter filter)
```

### removeResultReceiver

Removes a previously added result receiver.

```dart
Future<void> removeResultReceiver(CapturedResultReceiver receiver)
```

### resetSettings

Resets all of the settings to their default values.

```dart
Future<void> resetSettings() async
```

> *Exception* - "Failed to reset settings"

### setGlobalIntraOpNumThreads

Sets the global number of threads used internally by the library for model execution. This parameter could help regulate the resources needed to operate the Capture Vision Router instance.

```dart
static Future<void> setGlobalIntraOpNumThreads(int intraOpNumThreads)
```

**Remarks**

Setting the `intraOpNumThreads` input parameter to 0 lets the system decide the optimal number of threads. The default value is 0.

### setInput

Sets up an image source to provide images for continuous processing. This method is mainly used when configuring a camera (via the [`CameraEnhancer`](../camera-enhancer/camera-enhancer.md)) as an input source.

```dart
Future<void> setInput(ImageSourceAdapter input) async
```

**Remarks**

In most cases, the `ImageSourceAdapter` that will be used is a Camera Enhancer ([`CameraEnhancer`](../camera-enhancer/camera-enhancer.md)) instance to allow the user to use their phone's built-in camera.

> *Exception* - "Failed to set input"

### startCapturing

Starts the capturing process using the specified template. Any result(s) (of type [`CapturedResult`](captured-result.md)) that are received while the capture process is underway will be relayed by a result receiver, which is a callback function that is triggered once a captured result is found.

```dart
Future<void> startCapturing(String templateName)
```

**Remarks**

The template that is used during processing can be a preset template (one of [`EnumPresetTemplate`](../enum/preset-template.md)) or a customized JSON template that you create or that is provided to you by the Dynamsoft team.

> *Exception* - "Failed to start capturing"

### stopCapturing

Stops the capturing process and closes the camera.

```dart
Future<void> stopCapturing()
```

### switchCapturingTemplate

Switched the template used by the Capture Vision Router instance to the specified template name.

```dart
Future<void> switchCapturingTemplate(String templateName) async
```

**Remarks**

For the `templateName` input parameter, this can be either the name of the `CaptureVisionTemplate` in a custom JSON template file/string or the name of one of the preset templates available via [`EnumPresetTemplate`](../enum/preset-template.md).

> *Exception* - "Failed to switch template"

### updateSettings

Updates the specified template settings of the `CaptureVisionRouter` instance using a [`SimplifiedCaptureVisionSettings`](simplified-capture-vision-settings.md) object. To learn how to update the settings using the SimplifiedCaptureVisionSettings class - please refer to this [section of the Foundational User Guide]({{ site.dbr_flutter }}foundational-user-guide.md#using-simplifiedcapturevisionsettings).

```dart
Future<void> updateSettings(String templateName, SimplifiedCaptureVisionSettings settings)
```

**Remarks**

For the `templateName` input parameter, this can be either the name of the `CaptureVisionTemplate` in a custom JSON template file/string or the name of one of the preset templates available via [`EnumPresetTemplate`](../enum/preset-template.md).

> *Exception* - "Failed to update settings"
