# EnumGrayscaleEnhancementMode

`EnumGrayscaleEnhancementMode` is an enumeration that determines which grayscale enhancement modes the library will apply before the detection process to improve the read rate of the barcodes in a given image or frame.

## Definition

*Assembly:* dynamsoft_capture_vision_flutter

```dart
enum EnumGrayscaleEnhancementMode {
  skip(0),
  directBinarization(1 << 0),
  thresholdBinarization(1 << 1),
  grayEqualization(1 << 2),
  smoothing(1 << 3),
  morphing(1 << 4),
  deepAnalysis(1 << 5),
  sharpening(1 << 6),
  basedOnLocBin(1 << 7),
  sharpeningSmoothing(1 << 8),
  neuralNetwork(1 << 9),
  end(-1);
}
```

## Members

| Member | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `skip` | Disables any grayscale image preprocessing. Selecting this mode skips the preprocessing step, passing the image through to subsequent operations without modification. |
| `auto` | Automatic selection of grayscale enhancement mode which is currently not supported. Future implementations may automatically choose the most suitable enhancement based on image analysis. |
| `general` | Uses the original, unprocessed image for subsequent operations. This mode is selected when no specific grayscale enhancement is required, maintaining the image in its natural state. |
| `grayEqualize` | Applies a grayscale equalization algorithm to the image, enhancing contrast and detail in gray level. Suitable for images with poor contrast. |
| `graySmooth` | Implements a grayscale smoothing algorithm to reduce noise and smooth the image. This can be beneficial for images with high levels of grain or noise. |
| `sharpenSmooth` | Enhances the image by applying both sharpening and smoothing algorithms. This mode aims to increase clarity and detail while reducing noise, offering a balanced approach to image preprocessing. |
| `end` | Placeholder value with no functional meaning. |
