# EnumDrawingLayerId

`EnumDrawingLayerId` is an enumeration that defines the different drawing layers that the CameraView provides. The drawing layer is responsible for creating the highlight boxes around detected barcodes and other captured results. By default, there is a drawing layer assigned to each functional product under Capture Vision.
