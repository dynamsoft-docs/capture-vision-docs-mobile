# EnumDeblurMode

`EnumDeblurMode` is an enumeration that specifies the image processing algorithms applied to the localized zones containing barcodes, with the main aim being to generate a binary image for extracting barcode data during the final phase of the barcode decoding process.

## Definition

*Assembly:* dynamsoft_capture_vision_flutter

```dart
enum EnumDeblurMode {
  skip(0),
  directBinarization(1 << 0),
  thresholdBinarization(1 << 1),
  grayEqualization(1 << 2),
  smoothing(1 << 3),
  morphing(1 << 4),
  deepAnalysis(1 << 5),
  sharpening(1 << 6),
  basedOnLocBin(1 << 7),
  sharpeningSmoothing(1 << 8),
  neuralNetwork(1 << 9),
  end(-1);
}
```

## Members

| Member | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `skip` | Skips the process, no deblurring is applied. |
| `directBinarization` | Applies a direct binarization algorithm for generating the binary image. |
| `thresholdBinarization` | Utilizes a threshold binarization algorithm for generating the binary image, dynamically determining the threshold based on the image content. |
| `grayEqualization` | Employs a gray equalization algorithm to adjust the contrast and brightness, improving the clarity of the gray-scale image before binarization. |
| `smoothing` | Implements a smoothing algorithm to reduce noise and artifacts, smoothing out the gray-scale image before binarization. |
| `morphing` | Uses a morphing algorithm to enhance the gray-scale image before binarization. |
| `deepAnalysis` | Engages in a deep analysis of the grayscale image based on the barcode format to intelligently generate the optimized binary image, tailored to complex or severely blurred images. |
| `sharpening` | Applies a sharpening algorithm to enhance the edges and details of the barcode, making it more distinguishable on the grayscale image before binarization. |
| `basedOnLocBin` | Decodes the barcodes based on the binary image obtained during the localization process. |
| `sharpeningSmoothing` | Combines sharpening and smoothing algorithms for a comprehensive deblurring effect, targeting both clarity and smoothness of the gray-scale image before binarization. |
| `neuralNetwork` | Use the deep learning algorithm to recognize the barcodes. |
| `end` | Placeholder value with no functional meaning. |
