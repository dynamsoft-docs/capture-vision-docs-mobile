# ImageData

The `ImageData` class encapsulates all of an image's data, as well as metadata. It is used to represent an image, and the image's data can then be used for further operations such as analysis, viewing, or saving.

## Definition

*Assembly:* dynamsoft_capture_vision_flutter

```dart
class ImageData
```

## Constructors

```dart
ImageData({
  required this.bytes,
  required this.width,
  required this.height,
  required this.orientation,
  required this.format,
  required this.stride,
});
```

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| [`bytes`](#bytes) | *Uint8List* | Represents the raw bytes of the image. |
| [`width`](#width) | *int* | Represents the width of the image in *pixels*. |
| [`height`](#height) | *int* | Represents the height of the image in *pixels*. |
| [`orientation`](#orientation) | *int* | Represents the orientation of the image as an angle. |
| [`format`](#format) | *EnumImagePixelFormat* | Represents the pixel format of the image as a [`EnumImagePixelFormat`](enum/image-pixel-format.md). |
| [`stride`](#stride) | *int* | Represents the number of bytes in a single row of the image. |
