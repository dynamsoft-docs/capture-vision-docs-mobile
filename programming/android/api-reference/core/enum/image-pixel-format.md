# Enumeration ImagePixelFormat

`ImagePixelFormat` defines the range of pixel formats that an image can have, specifying how color and transparency data are represented in each pixel of the image.

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
public @interface EnumCapturedResultItemType
{
   /** 0:Black, 1:White. */
   public static final int IPF_BINARY = 0;
   /** 0:White, 1:Black. */
   public static final int IPF_BINARYINVERTED = 1;
   /** 8bit gray. */
   public static final int IPF_GRAYSCALED = 2;
   /** NV21. */
   public static final int IPF_NV21 = 3;
   /** 16bit with RGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address. */
   public static final int IPF_RGB_565 = 4;
   /** 16bit with RGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address. */
   public static final int IPF_RGB_555 = 5;
   /** 24bit with RGB channel order stored in memory from high to low address. */
   public static final int IPF_RGB_888 = 6;
