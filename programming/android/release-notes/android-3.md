  - Redesigned document normalization sections to better accommodate diverse document processing operations.
  
- Deep Learning Integration
  - Improved the reading rate of 1D barcode by introducing a new deblurring deep-learning model.
  - Enhanced text recognition capabilities with deep learning-based text-line recognition.

- Algorithm Enhancements
  - Enabled deduplication at the Region of Interest (ROI) level to consolidate results from multiple tasks.
  - Enhanced the text recognition workflow by integrating improved multi-step recognition processes and validation methods.
  - Improved the CODE_128 and DataMatrix DeepAnalysis algorithms for better decoding accuracy and performance.
  - Added support for new barcode types: CODE_32, MATRIX_25, KIX, and TELEPEN.
  - Added GS1 Application Identifiers (AI) support for improved code parsing capabilities.
