### Changed

- Added a new method, [`switchCapturingTemplate`]({{ site.dcv_android_api }}capture-vision-router/multiple-file-processing.html#switchcapturingtemplate), which allows switching templates dynamically during the image processing workflow.
- Added a new method, [`clearDLModelBuffers`]({{ site.dcv_android_api }}capture-vision-router/settings.html#cleardlmodelbuffers), to release memory by clearing buffered deep learning models.
- Added a new method, [`setGlobalIntraOpNumThreads`]({{ site.dcv_android_api }}capture-vision-router/settings.html#setglobalintraopnumthreads), to configure the global number of threads used for model execution.
- Added a new button, `cameraToggleButton`, to the `CameraView`, allowing users to switch between the front and back cameras.
The following APIs are provided for configuring the `cameraToggleButton`:
  - [`setCameraToggleButton`]({{ site.dce_android_api }}auxiliary-api/dcecameraview.html#setcameratogglebutton)
  - [`setCameraToggleButtonVisible`]({{ site.dce_android_api }}auxiliary-api/dcecameraview.html#setcameratogglebuttonvisible)
  - [`getCameraToggleButtonVisible`]({{ site.dce_android_api }}auxiliary-api/dcecameraview.html#getcameratogglebuttonvisible)

## 3.0.5000 (07/29/2025)

### New

- **Supported 16 KB page sizes**.

### Changed

- **License Validation Behavior**: Instead of stopping execution immediately on an invalid license module, the library now continues processing and returns results from modules with valid licenses. An error is still reported to indicate the license issue.

### Fixed

- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 3.0.3100 (05/30/2025)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `CameraEnhancer.open ` might not work when triggered before the finish of the onCreate of the lifecycle.
- Fixed a bug where the click event of the `ArcDrawingItem` might not be triggered when there is a `ScanRegion`.
- Fixed a bug where the `ArcDrawingItem` might be displayed incorrectly when there is a `ScanRegion`.

## 3.0.3000 (05/15/2025)
